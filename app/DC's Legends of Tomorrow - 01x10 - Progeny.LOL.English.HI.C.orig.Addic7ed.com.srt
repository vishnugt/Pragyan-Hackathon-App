We're headed to 2147 to engage Savage.

I owe you an apology, Mr. Rory.

36
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:45,411
I failed you.

37
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:47,112
I brought you along on this mission

38
00:01:47,114 --> 00:01:50,249
under false pretenses, in
denial of your true nature.

39
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:53,152
And when that nature took its course,

40
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:57,857
I asked Mr. Snart to...

41
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:01,660
deal with you.

42
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:04,029
My point being,

43
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:06,232
your quarrel should be
with me and not with him.

44
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:10,069
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

45
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:12,571

Yes, in the year 2080,

give way to corporations.

56
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:40,399

57

Ooh, sounds exciting.

00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:51,277
You think Savage takes over
the world by trading stocks?

62
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:52,912
What we do know is, in 20 years time,

63
00:02:52,914 --> 00:02:54,947
Kasnia is the foothold from which Savage

64
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:56,548
takes over the world, so we hardly want

65
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,684
to take him on there,
but if we can figure out

66
00:02:58,686 --> 00:03:03,122
how his actions here
lead to his rise to power,

67
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:04,456
then we won't need to.

00:34:44,561 --> 00:34:46,027
I want to exchange this woman's life

716
00:34:46,029 --> 00:34:48,930
for your captain, Rip Hunter.

717
00:34:48,932 --> 00:34:51,198
I have a better idea:

718
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,635
her life in exchange for his.

719
00:34:57,777 --> 00:34:59,410
Your son will be returned to you

720
00:34:59,412 --> 00:35:02,213
as soon as you guarantee our safe passage.

721
00:35:02,215 --> 00:35:04,048
Don't do it, Father.

722
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,449
If you let them go now,

723
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:08,552
they will only come back
for us in the future.

724
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:09,787
It's your choice.

725
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:12,723
[gun clicks, charges]

726
00:35:12,725 --> 00:35:14,191
Your son is right.

727
00:35:14,193 --> 00:35:17,294
We should kill them all.

728
00:35:19,032 --> 00:35:20,598
Put down your weapons!

729
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,000
- No, Father.
- Let my son go,

730
00:35:23,002 --> 00:35:25,236
and I will let you leave in peace.

731
00:35:25,238 --> 00:35:27,638
You have my word.

732
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,574
<i>[tense music]</i>

733
00:35:38,618 --> 00:35:43,421
Better find yourself a new mentor, kid.

734
00:36:10,186 --> 00:36:11,919
What do you want?

735
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:14,054
People seem to think we
should have a heart-to-heart.

736
00:36:14,056 --> 00:36:16,557
We don't have hearts.
Where does that leave us?

737
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:18,325
I've got a dozen reasons for killing you.

738
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:21,128
You've got a dozen and
one for killing me, so...

739
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,964
All the talk in the world
is not gonna change a thing.

740
00:36:23,966 --> 00:36:26,100
Exactly, here's my proposal.

741
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:30,137
I open this cell, we let
our fists do the talking.

742
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:39,547
When I kill you...

743
00:36:39,549 --> 00:36:41,816
You take the jump ship, make your escape,

744
00:36:41,818 --> 00:36:45,653
live out the rest of your
life anywhere you like.

745
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:48,556
Hmm.

746
00:36:48,558 --> 00:36:52,760
And if you kill me, well,

747
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:54,995
it's better than being
locked up in this place

748
00:36:54,997 --> 00:36:58,566
like some kind of circus freak.

749
00:36:58,568 --> 00:37:00,000
I take that as a yes.

750
00:37:00,002 --> 00:37:02,403
Sound the bell.

751
00:37:06,512 --> 00:37:08,012
Hey.

752
00:37:08,014 --> 00:37:09,446
You don't have to knock.

753
00:37:09,448 --> 00:37:11,649
- It's your room too.
- Yeah, I know.

754
00:37:11,651 --> 00:37:15,819
It's just... things have been weird.

755
00:37:15,821 --> 00:37:19,056
Since I told you I had a love child

756
00:37:19,058 --> 00:37:20,658
that I didn't really have,

757
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,593
or since you told me that
you're still in love with...

758
00:37:22,595 --> 00:37:26,163
You know what I love about you, Ray, is,

759
00:37:26,165 --> 00:37:28,933
you always manage to find the bright side.

760
00:37:28,935 --> 00:37:31,168
And no matter what, you never give up.

761
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:35,072
So please, don't give up on us.

762
00:37:35,074 --> 00:37:37,541
I'm not giving up,

763
00:37:37,543 --> 00:37:40,511
but it's hard to ignore the math.

764
00:37:40,513 --> 00:37:42,947
You and Carter have
spent lifetimes together,

765
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:47,217
and in each one, you've fallen in love,

766
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:49,887
so why would this
lifetime be any different?

767
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:56,293
Well, I never met you before.

768
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:02,066
Look, Ray, Carter is my past.

769
00:38:02,068 --> 00:38:06,003
You are my future.

770
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:21,018
Vandal.

771
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,854
Oh, I didn't expect you
up and about so soon.

772
00:38:23,856 --> 00:38:25,289
My father wanted me to rest,

773
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:27,591
but I wanted to resume my studies.

774
00:38:27,593 --> 00:38:29,059
Oh, good boy.

775
00:38:29,061 --> 00:38:30,961
So... where should we begin?

776
00:38:30,963 --> 00:38:34,031
Well, I was thinking Greek mythology.

777
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:36,333
Do you know the tale of Oedipus Rex?

778
00:38:36,335 --> 00:38:40,504
He was a prince of thieves
before his father exiled him.

779
00:38:40,506 --> 00:38:41,772
Why?

780
00:38:41,774 --> 00:38:45,275
Well, because the king was a coward.

781
00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:47,711
He had heard a prophecy
that one day his son

782
00:38:47,713 --> 00:38:51,615
would take his crown, so
he bound his boy's feet

783
00:38:51,617 --> 00:38:56,286
and tossed him into the woods to die.

784
00:38:56,288 --> 00:38:57,688
What did the boy do?

785
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,957
He did what he had to do.

786
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:02,226
And one day, the prophecy came true,

787
00:39:02,228 --> 00:39:06,764
and the prince became a
great and powerful king.

788
00:39:09,468 --> 00:39:11,835
Though it wasn't easy.

789
00:39:11,837 --> 00:39:14,605
Great things are never easy.

790
00:39:14,607 --> 00:39:17,541
<i>[dark music]</i>

791
00:39:24,383 --> 00:39:26,717

792

<i>Will now be released in a matter of days.</i>

798
00:39:52,344 --> 00:39:54,611
As you all know, our
former chairman's chair

799
00:39:54,613 --> 00:39:58,115
is in the Conglomerate passed to his son,

800
00:39:58,117 --> 00:40:02,219
who due to his age elected
me to act as his proxy.

801
00:40:06,261 --> 00:40:07,594
First order of business,

802
00:40:07,596 --> 00:40:10,396
I would like to revisit our discussion

803
00:40:10,398 --> 00:40:12,398
concerning the population crisis

804
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,367
beyond the Conglomerate's borders.

805
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:18,938
As we all know, we
already have a solution.

806
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,241
Did I do the right thing, Gideon?

807
00:40:21,243 --> 00:40:23,576
<i>Not committing murder
is generally considered</i>

808
00:40:23,578 --> 00:40:26,980
<i>the right thing, Captain.</i>

809
00:40:26,982 --> 00:40:31,484
In this instance...

810
00:40:31,486 --> 00:40:33,987
I wonder.

[both grunting]

812
00:40:53,675 --> 00:40:56,142
We had a deal, Mick.

813
00:40:56,144 --> 00:40:59,812
Kill me and you walk.

814
00:40:59,814 --> 00:41:02,815
It's what you wanted, isn't it,

815
00:41:02,817 --> 00:41:06,152
to get off the team?

816
00:41:06,154 --> 00:41:09,022
I don't know what I want anymore.

817
00:41:09,024 --> 00:41:11,958
Truth is, it doesn't matter.

818
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,894
What are you talking about?

819
00:41:14,896 --> 00:41:19,699
Whether I stay or leave, I'm dead.

820
00:41:19,701 --> 00:41:23,036
We're all dead.

<i>and this time, they're not
gonna take any chances.</i>

824
00:41:31,313 --> 00:41:34,881
They're called the Hunters, mercenaries,

825
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:38,117
and unlike me, there isn't
a human part left in them.

826
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:40,587
So they want to lock us all
up in the Vanishing Point?

827
00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:42,222
The Hunters do one thing:

828
00:41:42,224 --> 00:41:43,256
kill,

829
00:41:43,258 --> 00:41:45,258
whenever, wherever,

830
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,260
and they'll stop at nothing
till every single one of us

831
00:41:47,262 --> 00:41:49,862
is erased from the face of history.

832
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:54,067
Do you have any suggestions
as to how we might

833
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:56,236
outsmart them, Mr. Rory?

834
00:41:56,238 --> 00:41:58,404
Run.
